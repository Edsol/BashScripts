## bash_profile

Ties many of the BashScripts together for a super powerful system.

## bash_rc.aliases

This is arguably the most important piece of the project!

These dozens of aliases make working with Linux and developing
web app software much more efficient and streamlined.

Go check it out! [bash_rc.aliases](bash_rc.aliases)

## sudoers.d/00_prompt_once

This will make `sudo` only ask for your password ONE TIME during
a single boot. It won't ask across terminals and it won't time out.
On reboot, it will automatically expire.

## ssh-autologin

Automatically sets up (if needed) a SSH private key and installs it
on the remote server (creating the .ssh, if needed, as well.

## ssh-keyphrase-only-once.installer

Properly configures your OpenSSH client and installs `ssh-agent` in your `~/.bash_profile` in such a way
that you will only ever have to enter your SSH keyphrase once per login for anything that works with `ssh-agent`. 

## gitconfig

A highly-optimized .gitconfig for seasoned software developers ready to increase their daly productivity.
Install into ~/.gitconfig.

    git pretty
    git ll

Shows a beautiful multi-colored log with standard ISO dates:

![git pretty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1125541/94773688-e904c300-0381-11eb-878a-d0396d2bf102.png)

    git fix

Quickly jumps into rebasing the last two commits into one another.

    git alterego

Quickly switch the current repo to using your main alterego account for an previously-committed commit.

    git ego

The reverse of `git alterego`.

    git resign <hash>

Quickly resign bulk commits from <hash> to the latest.

This is particularly utilitarian when your GPG key expires and you need to renew it and then resign.

    git c: checkout
    git cp: cherry-pick
    git cpm: cherry-pick for Merge commits

Utility aliases to make git more efficient to use.

    git shows

Shows the GPG signature for every commit in `git log`.

## git-change-author

Easily bulk change the author's name and email of any of the commits in a git repository.

Usage: `git-change-author "Your Name" "email@address" [SHA1]`

## git-commit-at-modded-time

Use a file's modified time as the git time.

Example:

    $ ls -l american-date
     #-rwxrwxr-x+ 1 1MB Oct 14  2020  american-date
    $ ./git-commit-at-modded-time american-date
    $ git pretty american-date
    7462b66 G 2020-10-14 15:53:34 -0500 Theodore R. Smith

## git-mtime Git Modified Time Restorer

Restores each file's modification time in your working directory to when it was
last updated in the remote git repository.

When you checkout a repository & run this, your workdir goes from:

    -rwxrwxr-x+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Oct 22 01:58 changelog-maker-lite*
    -rw-rw-r--+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Oct 22 01:58 CHANGELOG.txt
    -rw-rw-r--+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Oct 22 01:58 gitconfig
    -rwxrwxr-x+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Oct 22 01:58 git-mtime

To:

    -rwxrwxr-x+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Oct  1 08:38 changelog-maker-lite*
    -rw-rw-r--+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Oct  1 01:10 gitconfig
    -rwxrwxr-x+ 1 tsmith users 1MB Sep 30 23:19 git-mtime

## git-same-sig-time

Unifies the GPG signature time with the commit's time.

## tar-sorted
 
Create tar files automatically sorted by file name.

This is particularly helpful on random-order file systems, such as ext4.

With the Bettergist Collector, we use this to be able to roughly estimate
how long compressing and extracting multiple-gigabyte files with millions
of files will take.

It is a drop-in replacement for `tar`, and uses the same arguments.

Optionally, you can install the function directly into your ~/.bashrc.

## cron.daily/00_clear-cache

- Empties out the ~/.cache directory of every non-root user.
- Empties out Pacman's package cache directory.

This can optionally use [nullfsvfs](https://github.com/abbbi/nullfsvfs) in order to limit wear-and-tear on SSDs.

## cron.daily/01_purge-locales

Removes every non-EN locale file every day.

This saves, usually, 400-1000 MB of space.

## cron.hourly/btrfs-snapshot

Takes BTRFS snapshots of / every hour on the hour.

## cron.daily/btrfs-snapshot

Cleans up the prior day's hourly snapshots while keeping the daily ones.

## american-date

A utility to print out dates in the American format

    Fri, 19 January 2024 05:49:20 CST

WiFi networks.

# Esoteric Utilities

## esoteric/arch-pacman-dupe-cleaner

Aids in automagically repairing duplicate Pacman database entries in Arch Linux.

It's meant to resolve the rare problem: "error: duplicated database entry 'foo'"

## esoteric/git-shallow-pull

Shallow updates a shallow `git clone --depth 1` repository.

## esoteric/init-btrfs-rootfs

### The Problem

Arch Linux sticks all of / in the main BTRFS subvolume (ID=5).

This means that common snapshotting and subvolume tasks,
particularly rolling back to a previously (e.g., working)
root subvolume is exceptionally difficult and requires a
rescue boot, etc.

### The Solution

The provided solution hotfixes the situation, hopefully without
the need for a rescue disk, on a live environment. However,
you really ought to have a rescue disk prepped in avance.

And for the love of God, make backups first!

## esoteric/clone-github-repos.php

Automagically downloads all of the GitHub repositories of a user or or an organization.
